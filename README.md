===

- Compact-MTX framework over LibGDX Scene2D 
- http://moribitotechx.blogspot.co.uk/

Info:
---------
- It is a Open Source Project Under Apache Licence, Version 2.0
- %100 Free and Awsome 
- Designed for Apps, Games & Live Wallpapers (Extremely easy and fast)
- Designed for far less code writing
- Built over LibGDX Scene2D
- Cross device resolution (Same quality in every device wiht Mtx v2.0 version, no more stretching)
- Designed for easier Scene / Stage / Group / Actor integration
- Designed for easier Menu Creations

- Designed for game specific purposes. For example, creating level buttons, setting special animations, getting screen time, integrating momentarily animations, multi-textured buttons, advanced actors, special setting management (volume, vibration, sfx and others.).
- Also usable for game logics, but it is heavily depends on Scene2D, it means that it is not %100 MVC supportive. However for games like puzzles, brain teasers, low-level platformers, low-level defence games, other low-level causal games, it may be suitable. Again, I warn you, it is not %100 MVC supportive.

What you need to know:
---------
- Basic knowledge and experience with Java, Android SDK, Eclipse and LibGDX
- Understanding the fundamentals of LibGDX Scene2D
- TexturePacking and TextureAtlas management (Not essential)

How can it be used:
